# System Architecture

## Bot Architecture
The application follows a dual command architecture supporting both Discord.js slash commands and traditional prefix commands (!). The main entry point (`index.js`) initializes the Discord client with necessary intents for guild, voice state, and message interactions. 

**üìÅ Project Structure:**
- `src/` - Core application modules (database.js, spotify.js)  
- `utils/` - Utility modules (health.js)
- `scripts/youtube/` - YouTube player scripts with proper naming
- `commands/` - Slash command modules
- `config/` - Bot configuration files
- Root directory - Main entry point and configuration files only

Commands are implemented both as modular files in the `commands/` directory and as inline prefix command handlers with complete error handling and security fixes.

## Music System Design
The core music functionality is built around an enhanced guild-specific queue system using JavaScript Maps for data storage. Each guild has its own `MusicQueue` instance that manages songs, playback state, volume, loop settings, autoplay, shuffle mode, and playback history. The system supports multiple audio sources with intelligent fallback mechanisms.

## Multi-Source Audio Processing
Audio streaming supports three main sources:
- **YouTube**: Direct URLs and search queries using ytdl-core and play-dl with fallback
- **Spotify**: Track and playlist URLs converted to YouTube equivalents via Spotify API
- **SoundCloud**: Direct streaming using soundcloud-downloader

## Command Structure
**Slash Commands**: Individual modules in `commands/` directory following Discord's slash command pattern
**Prefix Commands**: Centralized handler with shortcuts mapping (!p ‚Üí play, !s ‚Üí skip, etc.)
**Interactive Controls**: Button-based controls for pause, skip, volume, queue management

## Enhanced Queue Management
- Maximum 100 songs per queue with overflow protection
- Shuffle functionality with randomization algorithm
- Loop mode for repeating current track
- Autoplay system using YouTube's related video suggestions
- Playback history tracking (last 10 songs)
- Position tracking and queue navigation

## State Management
The bot maintains enhanced persistent state through in-memory storage using JavaScript Maps. Includes music queues, audio players, voice connections, user preferences, and playback statistics. All state is guild-specific and includes advanced features like autoplay settings and shuffle state.
